## Use Cases (How to test)

* Which Web API did you use, and where is it being used in the application?
* What are application use cases?

I used the Battery API to see what percent your battery is at. It is an event listener so it will change as your battery percentage changes without refreshing. The battery will also fill depending on how high or low your battery percentage is.

## Technical Write-up of selection of Web API selected:
The battery API is pretty sweet honestly, even though its not supported everywhere. It can tell what percent you are at, if you are charging and how long it hasnt been charged for.

## Self Reflection(s):
Learning this new API was sweet and it was a lot of fun to look at other APIs.

## How long it took me/us to finish this:
2 hours because I was researching, messing with styling, and seeing what other APIs there were.
## Group list, if applicable:
